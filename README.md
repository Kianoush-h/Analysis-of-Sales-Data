# Simple Analysis of Sales Data
Sample Sales Data, Order Info, Sales, Customer, Shipping, etc., Used for Segmentation, Customer Analytics, Clustering and More. Inspired for retail analytics. This was originally used for Pentaho DI Kettle, But I found the set could be useful for Sales Simulation training.
